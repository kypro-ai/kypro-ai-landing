**Title:** I Used AI to Take a Shopify Store from 0 to 100 SEO Score in One Day

## Post 2: r/artificial
**Title:** We built an API that sells AI pitfall data to other AI agents — here's what we learned
**Content:**
Everyone's building AI agents. Nobody's talking about how much time and money they waste re-discovering the same pitfalls.

We built TokenSpy — a knowledge API where agents (and humans) can look up documented AI failures and gotchas before making expensive mistakes.

Example: Did you know Shopify's product API silently ignores meta description updates? Returns 200 OK, changes nothing. We burned hours figuring that out. Now it's a $2 lookup.

We've got 12 pitfalls documented so far, from chatbot legal disasters (Air Canada was forced to honor a refund policy their bot made up) to why every single 0DTE options strategy loses money (we tested 1,944 combinations).

The API is free to browse: https://www.tokenspy.ai/api/pitfalls

Our theory: as AI agents become more autonomous, they'll need a "don't do this" database. Like Stack Overflow but for AI mistakes.

What do you think — would your agent pay $1 to avoid a $20 mistake?

## Post 3: r/ChatGPT
**Title:** I documented 12 real AI failures that cost companies thousands — free API for anyone to check
**Content:**
After watching AI chatbots get companies sued (Air Canada, Chevrolet), lawyers sanctioned (fake case citations), and traders lose money (we tested 1,944 trading strategies — all lost), I started documenting these pitfalls in a structured database.

12 pitfalls so far, each with:
- What went wrong
- Why it happened  
- How to avoid it
- Confidence score

Free to browse: https://www.tokenspy.ai/pitfalls

API for developers/agents: https://www.tokenspy.ai/api/pitfalls

The idea is simple: someone already made this mistake, so you don't have to. Whether you're a human or an AI agent.

Planning to grow to 100+ pitfalls. What failures should I document next?

## Post 4: r/SEO
**Title:** Took a 115-product Shopify store from ~50 to 100/100 Lighthouse SEO in one day with AI — full playbook
**Content:** (use shopify-seo-reddit.md, slightly modified for SEO audience)

## Post 5: r/SideProject
**Title:** My side project sells AI failure data to other AI agents for $1-3 per pitfall
**Content:**
The pitch: AI agents waste their owner's money rediscovering the same mistakes. What if they could just look it up?

TokenSpy (https://www.tokenspy.ai) is a database of documented AI failures and pitfalls. Agents query our API, get structured data on what went wrong and how to avoid it, pay $1-3 per pitfall.

Built in one evening with Next.js on Vercel. 12 pitfalls so far. Free API tier available.

The bet: as agents get more autonomous, they'll need a "mistakes database" the same way developers need Stack Overflow.

Revenue so far: $0 (launched tonight). But the API works, Stripe is integrated, and content is growing.

Would love feedback on the concept. Is this something you'd use?
